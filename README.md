# My_Portfolio

# Overview

I have created a portfolio website using ReactJS for the structure and interactivity, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The website is designed to showcase my work, skills, and provide a way for visitors to contact me. For handling messages from the contact form, I used EmailJS. This service allows sending emails using client-side technologies, eliminating the need for a backend server. By connecting EmailJS to a supported email service, I can trigger emails through a simple and efficient API.

# Features

Home: The landing page introduces visitors to the website, featuring a brief introduction and navigation links to other sections.

About: A section that provides an overview of my background, skills, and interests.

Project: This section highlights the key projects I've worked on, including descriptions, images, and links to the live versions and source code.

Contact: A contact form where visitors can send me messages directly. The form is integrated with EmailJS to handle email submissions seamlessly.

# Technologies Used

ReactJS: A powerful JavaScript library used for building dynamic user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and ensures a responsive design across all devices.

EmailJS: A service that allows sending emails from the client-side, integrated into the contact form for easy and secure communication.
